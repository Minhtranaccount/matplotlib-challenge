# Observations 

* There were 10 types of drugs used for testing on mice in which Capomulin and Ramicane had the most total numbers of timepoints while Propriva experienced the least timepoint number.

* The tests were done in both female and male mice with the numbers of 49% and 51% relatively.

* When timepoint increased, it seemed to be a decrease in the tumour volume spent for a particular mouse (example: Mouse ID - m601).

* There seemed to be a positive relationship between average tumour volume and mouse weight for a regimen (example: Capomulin regimen)
